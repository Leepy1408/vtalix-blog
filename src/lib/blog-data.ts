    content: `<h1 class="blog-heading">The Little Things That Shape Our Hearts</h1>

<p>When we think of mental health challenges, we often imagine life's big storms, breakups, job loss, serious illness, or traumatic events. But sometimes, it's the tiny moments that shape how we feel about ourselves and the world.</p>

<p>Take the story of a little girl who loved special scones. She would share them with her friends, making everyone happy. Weeks later, she saw the same friends eating the same scones but wasn't offered any. It was a small thing, but it felt huge to her. The feeling of exclusion settled in deep because, as a child, she didn't have the context or perspective to process it.</p>

<p>Years later, in her +2 Boards, she still remembered that moment. Not for the scone itself, but for the feeling of being left out, for the sense that kindness wasn't always reciprocated. That feeling connected to other disappointments—like when her father couldn't take her to the trampoline park. Over time, she learned to feel indifferent in such moments. She learned to expect less, feel less, hope less.</p>

<p>A quiet pattern built up inside her:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Small disappointments turning into lasting grudges</li>
  <li>Moments of joy being overshadowed by a sense of exclusion</li>
  <li> An emotional story replaying in her head over and over</li>
</ul>

<p>Without realizing it, her mental health was being shaped, not just by 'big' events, but by small, repeated moments she never processed.</p>

<h1 class="blog-heading">Mental Health: It’s Not Just About ‘Problems’</h1>

<p>Mental health isn't just about serious mental illness like, depression or anxiety or trauma (though those matter enormously). It's about how we navigate our everyday emotional world. How we make sense of disappointment. How we handle feeling left out. How wetalk to ourselves when things don't go as planned. It’s about how we think, feel, and respond to life, every day. It’s about the stories we tell ourselves and the emotions we carry forward.</p>

<p>Being mentally well means:</p>

<ul>
  <li> Understanding our emotions.</li>
  <li> Being curious about your own reactions instead of just accepting them (be introspective)</li>
  <li> Knowing how to respond instead of just reacting</li>
</ul>

<p>But here’s the truth; this is easier said than done. Most of us aren’t taught how to process emotions or break patterns that have been there for years. We're supposed to just... figure it out? While dealing with school, relationships, family expectations, and everything else life throws at us?</p>
<h1 class="blog-heading">Here’s Where We Step In</h1>

<p>At <b>Vtalix</b>, we believe that therapy should not be a last resort when everything falls apart.</p>
<p>
It should be a part of everyday wellness, not just when life feels heavy. Just the way one goes to the gym or eats healthy. After all you deserve a personal trainer for your emotional life because you want to be the healthiest most authentic version of yourself.</p>
<p>With <b>Vtalix</b>, finding the right therapist is just at your fingertips. You choose who you connect with, and how; chat, call, or video, at the time that suits your schedule.</p>
<p>Because mental wellness is not about “fixing what’s broken” it’s about understanding yourself, breaking emotional patterns, and untangling the patterns that don’t serve you anymore, and writing new chapters in your story</p>
<p>
<b>Small moments can have a big impact.</b></br>
The scone was never just a scone, it was a story about connection, kindness, and belonging.Your story - whatever small moments have shaped, it deserves to be heard, understood, and cared for.</p>

<p><b>It’s not the size of the wound, but how long we carry it, that shapes the heart.</b></p>
<p><b>Your emotions matter. Your story matters. And so do you</b></p>

      content: `React Hooks have revolutionized how we write components. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class. In this post, we'll explore the most common Hooks and some advanced patterns.

useState is the most basic hook. It lets you add React state to function components.

useEffect allows you to perform side effects in your components. Some examples of side effects are: fetching data, directly updating the DOM, and timers.

useContext is used to manage global state, like theme or user authentication. It allows you to avoid "prop drilling".

We will cover these and more, with practical examples to solidify your understanding. Get ready to level up your React skills!
